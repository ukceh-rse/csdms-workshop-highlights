# Context

## The Workshop {.smaller}

Took place October 28th-31st at Rydal Hall in the Lake District.

Aimed to answer the question: _what should the next generation of environmental models look like?_

## What's a CSDMS?

- _"a diverse community of experts promoting the modeling of earth surface processes by developing, supporting, and disseminating integrated software modules..."_^[https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/About_CSDMS]

- Based out of Colorado: https://csdms.colorado.edu/
- Maintain a curated [repository of compliant community models](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model_download_portal)

:::{.callout-note}
### CSDMS = Community Surface Dynamics Modelling System
:::


## The CSDMS Workbench

The [CSDMS Workbench](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Workbench) is designed to facilitate ... by

1. Interoperability of models via the [Basic Model Interface](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/BMI) (BMI)
2. [Variable naming standards](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/CSDMS_Standard_Names)
3. Language agnosticism via a [Python wrapper](https://github.com/csdms/babelizer) (Fortran, C, C++, ~Java, ~Julia)
4. Various tools for coupling model components exposing a BMI, setting up gridded experiments, and incorporating data

:::{.notes}
- Aim: build models from interoperable components
- Essence: wrap model code in (mostly) non domain-specific abstractions - making relatively few assumptions
- This is the BMI
- Concretely, in Python BMI is an ABC whose methods you should implement such that they execute appropriate parts of your model
- The Babelizer basically uses Cookiecutter and jinja2 templating to generate a Python package (complete with `pyproject.toml`) that contains this class (lots of `cdef` and `cpdef` involved)
- Result: reasonably flexible, extensible modelling and analysis framework
:::

## Extensions and Alternatives

- [eWatercycle](https://www.ewatercycle.org/) - [Netherlands eScience Centre](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/) (uses BMI)
  - We ran [this demo notebook](https://www.ewatercycle.org/eurocsdms_workshop/main/intro.html) on Datalabs
- The Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (FABM) - PML
- NextGen: next generation [National Water Model](https://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm) - NOAA (uses BMI)


# Joe's Highlights / Takeaways

## A toybox of models

## Containerised, BMI-ified JULES

# Mike's Highlights / Takeaways

## Modular modelling systems

- Moving towards a system of modular models rather than large complex codebases
- Enables easier coupling of models
- Allows adaptation to ever changing environmental challenges: Easily swap one model for another depending on challenge at hand

## Ethical and sustainability of models

- How sustainable are our models? - we need to balance the good the models can produce with the carbon impact of running them
- Ethical considerations - Have we considered the societal impact of our models (E.g. informing policy)? Have we involved the communities impacted in the development of models?
- Ethical considerations - Modellers often want to help after a natural disaster (E.g. flooding) but could this be perceived as help or trying to advance careers on back of disaster?

## Getting modellers out of their silos

- Picking on hydrologists here but why so many different models? Should there be more community collaboration?
- Linking models requires making them easier to couple with other models - E.g. using the CSDMS BMI approach 

# Carolynnes Highlights


# Next steps

## Next steps

- Set up _Euro_-CSDMS
- Writing a kind of proceedings / workshop outcomes paper
- Set up a community forum on Discourse (done! https://forum.csdms.io/)
- Looking for funding for future events
- Developing training tools (toybox)
- _In situ_ hackathons + citizen science projects (solve the system)
