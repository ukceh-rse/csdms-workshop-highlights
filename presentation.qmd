## What's a CSDMS?

![](images/CSDMS-logo-flat.png){.absolute bottom=0 right=0 width=30%}

CSDMS = **Community Surface Dynamics Modelling System**, based out of [Univ. Colorado Boulder](https://csdms.colorado.edu)

> _"a diverse community of experts promoting the modeling of earth surface processes by developing, supporting, and disseminating integrated software modules..."_^[https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/About_CSDMS]


They maintain a curated [repository of compliant community models](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model_download_portal).

The [CSDMS Workbench](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Workbench) is an integrated system of tools and standards for modelling:

- Interoperability of models via the [Basic Model Interface](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/BMI) (BMI) and common [variable naming standards](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/CSDMS_Standard_Names)
- Language agnosticism via a [Python wrapper](https://github.com/csdms/babelizer) (Fortran, C, C++, ~Java, ~Julia)
- Various tools for coupling model components exposing a BMI, setting up gridded experiments, and incorporating data

:::{.notes}
- Aim: build models from interoperable components
- Essence: wrap model code in (mostly) non domain-specific abstractions - making relatively few assumptions
- This is the BMI
- Concretely, in Python BMI is an ABC whose methods you should implement such that they execute appropriate parts of your model
- The Babelizer basically uses Cookiecutter and jinja2 templating to generate a Python package (complete with `pyproject.toml`) that contains this class (lots of `cdef` and `cpdef` involved)
- Result: reasonably flexible, extensible modelling and analysis framework

## Extensions and Alternatives

- [eWatercycle](https://www.ewatercycle.org/) - [Netherlands eScience Centre](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/) (uses BMI)
  - We ran [this demo notebook](https://www.ewatercycle.org/eurocsdms_workshop/main/intro.html) on Datalabs
- The Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (FABM) - PML
- NextGen: next generation [National Water Model](https://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm) - NOAA (uses BMI)


# Joe's highlights

## A toybox of models

- A small group of us (including Ed Rowe and myself) discussed training and knowledge-sharing across domains in depth.

- We proposed to populate a GitHub repository with a growing collection of **BMI-compliant toy models** of all shapes and sizes.

- From a training perspective the common BMI framework is helpful for both novices and experienced modellers:

  - It ought to **reduce the cognitive load** for learners new to modelling, since you can get started and run models without needing to know too many details or going through a complicated set up.

  - It should also facilitate lateral learning since BMI serves as a map for exploring new models, potentially from other domains.

- **Get in touch** if you'd be interested in contributing!

## Containerised, BMI-ified JULES

- I had an interesting conversation with an RSE from the Netherlands eScience Center who had **containerised an old and slow Matlab model and exposed a BMI interface** that could receive inputs and send outputs over HTTP.

- Initial reaction: cute but **not generally a good idea for large-scale modelling** (communications will become a bottleneck very quickly).

- But really this is only a problem for tightly-coupled models (think atmospheric dynamics). Meanwhile JULES is essentially a 1+1 dimensional model -- decoupled in 2/3 spatial domains.

- A **containerised, BMI-ified JULES could be a convenient alternative** route to working with JULES, **using Python and generic computing resources** (i.e. without Jasmin)


:::{.notes}
- Naive parallelisation over lat-lon (which is essentially decoupled in JULES) is then very scalable, and there are no blocking communications (as with MPI/OpenMP)
- Reminds me of Faiza, Sam and Qianhui's project on microservice architectures for modelling
- CEH looking to do an inter-model comparison study: could this be useful? Or more generally the BMI approach.
- I'm not planning to work on this with urgency, but would happily do it if the need should arise.

# Mike's highlights

## Modular modelling systems

- Moving towards a system of modular models rather than large complex codebases
- Enables easier coupling of models
- Allows adaptation to ever changing environmental challenges: Easily swap one model for another depending on challenge at hand

## Ethical and sustainability of models

- How sustainable are our models? - we need to balance the good the models can produce with the carbon impact of running them
- Ethical considerations - Have we considered the societal impact of our models (E.g. informing policy)? Have we involved the communities impacted in the development of models?
- Ethical considerations - Modellers often want to help after a natural disaster (E.g. flooding) but could this be perceived as help or trying to advance careers on back of disaster?

## Getting modellers out of their silos

- Picking on hydrologists here but why so many different models? Should there be more community collaboration?
- Linking models requires making them easier to couple with other models - E.g. using the CSDMS BMI approach

# Next steps

## Next steps

- [x] Set up a community forum on Discourse (done! https://forum.csdms.io/)
- [ ] Writing a kind of proceedings / workshop outcomes paper (in progress)
- [ ] Set up _Euro_-CSDMS
- [ ] Developing training tools (including the toybox)
- [ ] Looking for funding for future events
- [ ] _In situ_ hackathons + citizen science projects (solve the system)
